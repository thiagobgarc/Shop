# Talk2Me

### This is my second project with General Assembly

## Experiences

## BAD

  I Began this project attempting to create an <strong>Instant Messaging</strong> application that will create a user and that user will be able to communicated with other users. Once that user leaves the chatroom then the user "deleted." During this attempt I learned socket.io which was one of the recommendations from other delevopers from my research. However, it didnt go as planned. I had a major bug that took me five days, and on the fifth day I had to drop my original project idea. I had let my instuctors know and attempt to create a CRUD/7 RESTFUL application in order to meet MVP requirements.

## Good

  This awful experience has been beneficial, though. If I had not dropped the idea, then I would never have figured out the main issue on why the Instant Messaging application did not work. It had something to do with my '.env' file connecting to MongoAtlas. Thankfully, Hunter pointed it out and I was able to get everything working again. 
    
  However, I had 4 days to create a project that met MVP requirements. I did not think it would be impossible, it would be difficult. General Assemebly has helped me a lot through this whole odeal because of the the amount of practice I had on creating projects with 'express, MONGODB, Mongoose, and ejs', I was able to write all the routes needed. 

  Sure, I had a lot of errors along the way but the experience of being pressured helped me gain confidence in my work and I woudlnt trade the experience with any other way. 

## User Experience

  This Full-Stack Application is a shop. However, it is not like most shops that you can browse without requiring to login. Login is a requirement and you will not be granted access to the shop without it. 

  ## Website

    The front page consists of a welcome and basic description of the sign up and login. They will have buttons according if you have an account or not. After logging in, you will be redirected to the shop.

    At the shop route you will be able to edit or delete any of the products listed. And if you are interested in a product, you can click on it's image and it will redirect you to the show route. 

    The show route will give you basic information and you will see the the edit and delete buttons. Also a buy and like button. 

    Creating an item is on the shop route where any user, once logged in, will be able to add any item they desire (it does not have to be electronic, but perferred)

  ## Things to work on later

    The chatroom portion where it will be a place communicate and trouble shoot any bugs the users come accross. 

    The CSS layout will be another one. I am not a fan of using CSS, however, as I advance in the course I will be better equip to give a better design to the Full-Stack application.
